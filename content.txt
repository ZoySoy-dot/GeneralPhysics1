<h2>Units, Physical Quantities, and Vectors</h2>
<p>Physics describes the universe with measurements. But a number by itself is meaningless. Is it 5 feet, 5 kilograms, or 5 seconds? And which way is it going? This is where we learn to speak the language of physics clearly.</p>

<h3>Vector Operations by Components</h3>
<p>To break a vector down into its x and y components (its "shadows" on the axes), we use some simple trigonometry:</p>
$$ A_x = |\\vec{A}| \\cos(\\theta) \\quad , \\quad A_y = |\\vec{A}| \\sin(\\theta) $$
<p>The beauty of components is that they make vector addition simple. Instead of complicated geometry, you just add the x-parts together and the y-parts together:</p>
$$ R_x = A_x + B_x \\quad , \\quad R_y = A_y + B_y $$
<p>Once you have the resultant's components ($R_x, R_y$), you can put them back together to find its overall magnitude and direction using the Pythagorean theorem and arctangent:</p>
$$ |\\vec{R}| = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2} \\quad , \\quad \\theta_R = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{R_y}{R_x}\\right) $$

    <h4><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i>Real-World Example: GPS Navigation</h4>
    <p>When your GPS tells you to "go 2 miles northeast," it's using vector addition! The GPS breaks your journey into components:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li><strong>Eastward component:</strong> 2 × cos(45°) = 1.41 miles east</li>
        <li><strong>Northward component:</strong> 2 × sin(45°) = 1.41 miles north</li>

<div class="info-box advanced-box">
    <h4><i data-lucide="brain-circuit"></i>Advanced Learning: The Dot and Cross Products</h4>
    <p class="mt-2">Besides adding, there are two special ways to multiply vectors:</p>
    <p><strong>1. The Dot Product (Scalar Product):</strong> This tells you how much two vectors align or point in the same direction. The result is just a number (a scalar), not a new vector. It's perfect for calculating <strong>Work</strong>, which depends on how much a force is aligned with the direction of motion.</p>
    $$ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = |\\vec{A}| |\\vec{B}| \\cos(\\theta) = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z $$
    <p><strong>Physical interpretation:</strong> If θ = 0° (parallel), dot product is maximum. If θ = 90° (perpendicular), dot product is zero.</p>
    <p><strong>2. The Cross Product (Vector Product):</strong> This tells you how much "twist" or "leverage" one vector has on another. The result is a brand new vector that points perpendicular to the two original vectors. This is essential for understanding things that rotate, like calculating <strong>Torque</strong> (the rotational equivalent of force).</p>
    $$ |\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B}| = |\\vec{A}| |\\vec{B}| \\sin(\\theta) $$
    <p><strong>Direction rule:</strong> Use the right-hand rule - point fingers along first vector, curl toward second vector, thumb points in direction of cross product.</p>

<h2>Kinematics: Describing Motion</h2>
<p>Kinematics is the part of physics that describes <strong>how</strong> things move, without worrying about <strong>why</strong> they move. We'll focus on position, velocity, and acceleration - the fundamental concepts that describe all motion in the universe.</p>

<h3>Understanding Motion: The Big Picture</h3>
<p>Motion is everywhere! From the molecules vibrating in your coffee cup to galaxies spinning through space, everything in the universe is in motion. Kinematics gives us the mathematical tools to describe and predict this motion precisely.</p>

<div class="example-box">

<p><strong>2. Law of Acceleration:</strong> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass. This is the most famous equation in physics!</p>
$$ \\sum \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} $$
<p>In simple terms: More force means more acceleration. More mass means less acceleration for the same push.</p>
<p><strong>3. Law of Action-Reaction:</strong> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If object A pushes on object B, then object B pushes back on object A with a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.</p>
$$ \\vec{F}_{A \\text{ on } B} = -\\vec{F}_{B \\text{ on } A} $$

    <h4><i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i>Common Pitfall: Action-Reaction Pairs</h4>
    <p class="mt-2">A crucial detail about the 3rd Law: the action and reaction forces <strong>always act on different objects</strong>. They NEVER cancel each other out. Your weight is the Earth pulling you down. The reaction force is YOU pulling the Earth up! The normal force from the floor pushing up on your feet is the reaction to your feet pushing down on the floor. Don't mix them up!</p>

<h2>Work, Energy, and Power</h2>
<p>Energy is one of the most fundamental concepts in all of science. Think of it as the "currency" that makes things happen. Work is the process of transferring that energy, and Power is how fast you transfer it.</p>

<h3>Work and the Work-Energy Theorem</h3>
<p>Work is the bridge connecting forces and energy. The <strong>Work-Energy Theorem</strong> is a powerful shortcut: it says that the total work done by all forces on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy. </p>
$$ W_{net} = \\Delta K = K_f - K_i $$
<p>So, if you do positive work, the object speeds up. If you do negative work, it slows down.</p>

<h3>Conservation of Mechanical Energy</h3>
<p>This is a HUGE idea in physics. If the only forces doing work are conservative (like gravity or spring forces, but NOT friction), then the total mechanical energy of a system doesn't change. It just transforms between kinetic and potential energy.</p>
$$ E_i = E_f \\implies K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f $$
<p>Think of a rollercoaster: at the top of a hill, it's mostly potential energy. As it rushes down, that potential energy converts into kinetic energy (speed)!</p>
<p>If non-conservative forces like friction are present, energy isn't conserved (it turns into heat): $$W_{nc} = \\Delta E$$.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>Power is all about how fast you get work done. Lifting a heavy box quickly requires more power than lifting it slowly, even though the work done is the same.</p>
$$ P_{avg} = \\frac{W}{t} \\quad \\text{or instantaneously,} \\quad P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v} $$

<h3>Impulse and Conservation of Momentum</h3>
<p>The relationship between impulse and momentum is key: $$ \\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p} $$. To change an object's momentum, you need to apply a force over a certain time. This is why airbags work: they increase the time of impact, which decreases the force on the driver for the same change in momentum.</p>
<p>The <strong>Law of Conservation of Momentum</strong> is a cornerstone of physics. It states that for any interaction (like a collision or explosion), if there are no external forces on the system, the total momentum before the event is equal to the total momentum after the event. </p>
$$ \\sum \\vec{p}_{initial} = \\sum \\vec{p}_{final} $$
<p><strong>This law is your master key to solving ALL collision problems.</strong> In any collision, momentum is conserved. Energy is only conserved in elastic collisions.</p>

<h2>Rotational Equilibrium and Dynamics</h2>

<h3>Torque and Moment of Inertia</h3>
<p><strong>Torque</strong> is not just about how hard you push, but also *where* you push. Pushing on a door far from its hinges creates more torque and is easier than pushing near the hinges. The formula is $$ \\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} $$, where $\\vec{r}$ is the vector from the pivot to where the force is applied.</p>
<p>Just like Newton's second law for linear motion ($F=ma$), there's a version for rotation:</p>
$$ \\sum \\vec{\\tau} = I\\vec{\\alpha} $$
<p>This says that a net torque causes an angular acceleration. The <strong>Moment of Inertia ($I$)</strong> tells you how much the object resists this. An object with its mass far from the center (like a big wheel) has a large $I$ and is hard to spin. An object with its mass close to the center (like a solid disk) has a smaller $I$ and is easier to spin.</p>
<p>The <strong>Parallel Axis Theorem</strong> is a handy tool to calculate $I$ if you're spinning an object around a point other than its center of mass: $$I = I_{CM} + Md^2$$.</p>

<h3>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>
<p>The force of gravity depends on two things: how massive the objects are, and how far apart they are. The force is stronger for more massive objects, and gets much weaker as the objects get farther apart (an inverse square law).</p>
$$ F_g = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$

<h3>Escape Velocity</h3>
<p>To escape a planet's gravity, you need to be going fast enough that its pull can't bring you back down. This happens when your initial kinetic energy is equal to the gravitational potential energy holding you there. For Earth, this speed is about 11.2 km/s (over 40,000 km/h)!</p>
$$ v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} $$
<p>Notice that the escape velocity depends on the planet's mass ($M$) and radius ($R$), but not on the mass of the object that is escaping.</p>

<h3>Wave Properties</h3>

$$ v = f\\lambda $$

<h3>The Doppler Effect</h3>
<p>This is the classic "siren effect." When an ambulance is racing towards you, the sound waves get bunched up, so you hear a higher frequency (higher pitch). When it's racing away, the waves get stretched out, so you hear a lower frequency (lower pitch). The same thing happens with light from distant stars!</p>
$$ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v_{sound} \\pm v_{observer}}{v_{sound} \\mp v_{source}} \\right) $$
<p>The signs depend on whether the source and observer are moving towards or away from each other. The general rule is: use the top sign for "towards" motion.</p>

<h3>The Laws of Thermodynamics</h3>
<p><strong>First Law: Conservation of Energy.</strong> This is a restatement of energy conservation, but for thermodynamic systems. It says that the change in a system's internal energy ($\Delta U$) is equal to the heat added to the system ($Q$) minus the work done by the system ($W$).</p>
$$ \\Delta U = Q - W $$
<p>In short: energy can't be created or destroyed, only moved around or changed in form.</p>
<p><strong>Second Law: The Law of Increasing Entropy.</strong> This law has many forms, but they all point to one thing: disorder wins. Heat naturally flows from hot to cold, not the other way around. No engine can be 100% efficient because some energy is always lost as waste heat, increasing the universe's overall entropy.</p>

<h3>Heat Engines</h3>
<p>A heat engine is a practical application of thermodynamics. It uses the natural flow of heat from a high-temperature source to a low-temperature "sink" to perform work. The Second Law places a hard limit on how efficient an engine can be. The theoretical maximum efficiency is called the Carnot efficiency:</p>
$$ \\eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H} $$
<p>This shows that a bigger temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs leads to a higher possible efficiency.</p>
